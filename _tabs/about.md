For the last 20 years, I've designed and led data-driven voter contact and paid communications programs that win elections and shape policy. Since 2014, I have worked in polling - starting as an Analyst and most recently as a Vice President at a Colorado-based  firm. During this time I've continued to lead campaigns in various roles, including as a Field Director, Campaign Manager, and General Consultant. I've produced TV ads, written mail, managed staff, and balanced budgets. 

**My hands-on campaign experience has given me a unique perspective for delivering actionable insights for clients, persuasively communicating findings to stakeholders, and effectively supporting the work of diverse teams.**

### Research Experience

As a pollster, I have managed more than $4 million in survey research, supporting $100+ million in campaign spending for advocacy organizations, targeted congressional campaigns, competitive statewide and municipal campaigns, and landmark tax measures to raise funding for housing, schools, and health care. I've led or contributed to more than 275 public opinion and election-related studies, including managing all phases of each project â€“ from client engagement, questionnaire design, sampling, fielding, and post-processing, through analysis and storytelling. 

### Campaign Experience

On the campaign trail, I've been the campaign manager for multimillion-dollar paid communications programs to support candidates and ballot measures, executing on the full suite of paid media, including advertising on broadcast, cable, radio, and streaming platforms. In 2020, I was the General Consultant for campaigns to create Colorado's Paid Family Leave program, to defeat conservative anti-tax measures, and establish a dedicated revenue source in Denver to fund homeless services. Previously, I led voter contact programs for congressional special elections in Pennsylvania and Oregon, mayoral campaigns and statewide ballot measures in Colorado, and as a National Regional Field Director at the DCCC overseeing programs in 12 states.
