For the last 20 years, I've designed and led data-driven voter contact and paid communications programs that win elections and shape policy. Since 2014, I have worked in polling - starting as an Analyst and most recently as a Vice President at a Colorado-based  firm. During this time I've continued to lead campaigns in various roles, including as a Field Director, Campaign Manager, and General Consultant. 

**My hands-on experience leading campaigns - writing TV ads and direct mail, managing staff, and balancing budgets - has given me a unique perspective for delivering actionable research insights for clients, persuasively communicating key findings to stakeholders, and effectively supporting the work of diverse teams.**

### Research Experience

As a pollster, I have managed more than $4 million in survey research, supporting $100+ million in campaign spending. Key clients have included landmark ballot measures to fund free school meals (Prop FF) and affordable housing (Prop 123) in Colorado, competitive campaigns to elect Denver Mayors Mike Johnston and Michael Hancock, and independent expenditure work to support candidates for statewide, legislative, and local offices. 

I’ve led or contributed to more than 275 public opinion and election-related studies, including managing all phases of survey research projects, producing incisive key findings to inform decision making, and extending survey data to build models that drive spending. 

### Campaign Experience

On the campaign trail, I’ve been the campaign manager for multimillion-dollar paid media programs to support candidates and ballot measures. In 2020, I was a General Consultant for campaigns to create Colorado’s Paid Family Leave program, to defeat conservative anti-tax measures, and establish a dedicated revenue source in Denver to fund homeless services. Previously, I led campaigns to twice re-elect Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and pass ballot measures to support billions in public infrastructure spending. Early in my career, I designed and led voter contact programs for congressional special elections in Pennsylvania and Oregon, mayoral campaigns and statewide ballot measures in Colorado, and as a National Regional Field Director at the DCCC overseeing programs in 12 states.
