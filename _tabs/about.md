For the last 20 years I have designed and led data-driven voter contact and paid communications programs that win elections and shape policy. I have worked in polling since 2014, starting as an Analyst and most recently as a Vice President at a Colorado-based polling firm. During this time I've continued to lead campaigns in a number of roles, including as a Field Director, Campaign Manager, and General Consultant. I've produced TV ads, written mail, managed staff, and balanced a budget. 

My hands-on campaign experience has given me a unique ability to produce actionable insights for clients, communicate findings to principals, and support the work of other team members.
