This is an interactive dashboard to explore early voting trends and turnout in Colorado's 2024 General Election. This dashboard was coded using the Shiny package in R. Voting data was provided by the Colorado Secretary of State. Expected turnout in the 2024 election is based on a multi-level logistic regression model trained on vote history from the 2020 Colorado voter file and demographic information from the Cooperative Election Study.
